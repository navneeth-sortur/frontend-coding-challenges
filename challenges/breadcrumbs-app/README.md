# React Breadcrumbs Navigation

A simple React application that demonstrates how to implement **dynamic breadcrumbs** and **nested routing** using React Router v6.

This project focuses on functionality rather than UI styling — built to resemble a typical frontend interview task where candidates are expected to implement breadcrumb navigation dynamically based on the current route.
